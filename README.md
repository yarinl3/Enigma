This is a simulator of enigma.<br>
[Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication.<br>
It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.<br>
This simulator accurately simulates the components in the machine that include: mixers, reflector and 6 letter exchange cables.<br>
For convenience I have created a user interface using tkinter.
